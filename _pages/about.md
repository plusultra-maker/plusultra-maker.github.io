Who Am I?
======
I am a third-year undergraduate student majoring in __Computer Science__ at [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/), China. My research interest lies in __computer graphics__, __character animation__, and __robotics__. I am also a fan of AI fields, such as __reinforcement learning__ and __generative models__. In particular, I am fascinated by the stylish and vivid character animation in physics-based simulation, and I am eager to explore the potential of generation models in this field.
Under the guidance of [Prof. Libin Liu](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/shimin/), I am currently working on a project about _GAN-based Stylized Physics-based Character Control Generation_. 

Recent Work
======
I would like to share my recent work with you, though it is still under construction.
