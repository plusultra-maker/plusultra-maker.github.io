Who Am I?
======
I am a third-year undergraduate student majoring in **Computer Science** at [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/), China. My research interest lies in **computer graphics**, **character animation**, and **robotics**. I am also a fan of AI fields, such as **reinforcement learning** and **generative models**. In particular, I am fascinated by the stylish character animation in physics-based simulation, and I am eager to explore the potential of generation models in this field.

Under the guidance of [Prof. Libin Liu](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/shimin/), I am currently working on a project about *GAN-based Stylized Physics-based Character Control Generation* and *Muscle-driven Character Control* in a more biologically plausible way..


Recent Work
======
I would like to share my recent work with you, though it is still under construction.
### 3-cc fatigue control using AMP

This is a approach to train a control policy for 3-cc fatigue restricted character based on AMP. We look forward to the potential of GAN-based learning methods to generate more stylish policies with both more data or special physical constraints.

More details will be updated soon.
