Who Am I?
======
I am a undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science at Peking University[https://english.pku.edu.cn/], China. I am interested in computer graphics, computer vision, and machine learning. I am also a fan of open source software and Linux. I am currently working on a project about 3D reconstruction and rendering.
