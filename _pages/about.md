This is Boyang Yu (喻勃洋) 's homepage on the Web! Welcome!

Who Am I?
======
I am a third-year undergraduate student majoring in **Computer Science** at [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/), China. My research interest lies in **computer graphics**, **character animation**, and **robotics**. I am also a fan of AI fields, such as **reinforcement learning** and **generative models**. In particular, I am fascinated by the stylish character animation in physics-based simulation, and I am eager to explore the potential of generation models in this field.

Under the guidance of [Prof. Libin Liu](https://libliu.info/), I am currently working on a project about *GAN-based Stylized Physics-based Character Control Generation* and *Muscle-driven Character Control* in a more biologically plausible way..


Recent Work
======
I would like to share my recent work with you, though it is still under construction.
### 3-cc fatigue control using AMP

This approach aims to train a control policy for 3-CC fatigue-restricted characters based on AMP. We anticipate that GAN-based learning methods hold potential to generate more stylish policies, either with larger datasets or under specific physical constraints

More details will be updated soon.
